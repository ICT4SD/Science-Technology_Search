# Science_Technology_Search
Build a searchable collection of science and technology knowledge useful to implement the Sustainable Development Goals.

The internet has billions of pages. This project aims to build a curated collection of content relevant to sustainable development, keeping and categorizing content from high quality sources. Such as:

- Websites, papers and publications from recognized academic institutions
- Training materials from recognized online repositories
- Projects and tools from civil society
- Websites from government offices worldwide

For example, if you were to search for "child nutrition tools" the results set would be expected to include for example:
- Courses from edx.org, coursera.com, etc.
- Papers from the World Health Organization, UNICEF, Universities, and from journals in the Directory of Open Access Journals, etc.
- Projects from the Global Innovation Exchange, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, etc.
- Videos, web, and other materials from governmental websites around the world.

##Getting started

Navigating the vast amount of content abailable on the Internet is daunting, a way to get started could be to narrow the collection to include only websites belonging to this narrow list of owners:

- [National Goverments](http://www.un.org/en/member-states/index.html), this is a list maintained by the United Nations listing the Permanent Missions of the Member States of the United Nations.
- [List of non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations](http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=E/2015/INF/5), this list was obtained from [here](http://csonet.org/).
- [List of academic institutions in the United Nations Academic Impact](https://academicimpact.un.org/sites/academicimpact.un.org/files/UNAI%20MEMBERS%20LIST%20September%202016.pdf), this list was obtained from [here](https://academicimpact.un.org)
